<h1>Webapp for tutor listings</h1>

This web application is served using express. The databasing is done through updating of a JSON file. 
You can create a new listing, filter/search for listings, and view individual tutor profiles.

In this project we used HTML, CSS, JS, and handlebars.

Instructions:

1. Clone
2. Open terminal
3. npm install
4. Type npm run start
5. Go to browser and visit http://localhost/whatever_the_port_number_is

In the future we plan on moving away from JSON databasing and use something that allows us to scale.
